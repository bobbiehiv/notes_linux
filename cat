cat
===============================================

cat can be used for more than just displaying text 

you can also join multiple files together

for instance if you had movie.mpeg.001 movie.mpeg.002 .... 
movie.mpeg.099

you could join them all together with the following 

$ cat movie.mpeg.0* > movie.mpeg

and because wildcards always expand in sorted order the arguements 
will be arranged in the correct order 

cat with no arguements will give you a promp to echo 

$ cat 
enter text here 
ctrl-D

we can use this to create small text files 

$ cat > dumbo.txt
more dumb text here 

$ cat dumbo.text 
more dumb text here 

we can redirect it as well back to std output 

$ cat < dumbo.txt
