=================================
Enviroment varibles 
=================================

to find enviroment varibles use the env command

$ env
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000
XAUTHORITY=/run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority
XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/etc/xdg/xdg-ubuntu:/etc/xdg
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/game
s:/snap/bin
	(There'll be way more)

Look at the PATH entry, this contains the directories where your shell
and other Programs will look for other programs with out having to 
specifiy a complete path 
	this makes is so you can run a binary program from the other 
	directories

Use echo to print whatever you tell it 

$ echo "Hey stupid"

you can feed it the name of an enviroment varible as well
	tell echo that it is a varible by prefacing with $ 

$ echo $PATH
	will print everything that $PATH contains

use the = to create your own varibles

$ myvar=gayguy

$ echo $myvar
  gayguy
	this creates a varible that is only locally available

$ export myvar 
	passes the varible to the subsequent child processes

loose all the varibles by closing all sessions or use

$ unset myvar

using just set is similar to using env 
	however set will output all varibles and functions

$ env | grep mynewvar

$ set | grep mynewvar
  maynewvar=goodbye

------------------
special characters
------------------

$ touch my new file
	creates 3 seperate files

$ touch "my new file"
	creates 1 with spaces in qoutes 

$ touch my\ new\ file
	does the same thing by escaping the space
