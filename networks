to see ip address info run 

# ip address show 

to see routes 

# ip route show

to manually configure interfaces yo can do the following 
however it may be easier to use something like 
'netplan' to build your config in a text file

bind an interface to the internet layer with the ip comand

$ ip address add address/subnet dev interface 

or more specifically 

$ ip address add 192.168.1.123/24 dev eth0

once up yo can add routes, like the gateway 

$ ip route add default via gw-address dev interface 

or 

$ ip address add default 192.168.1.1 dev eth0

to remove the defaul gateway run 

$ ip route del default

you can also speiciy routes 

$ ip route add 192.168.45.0/24 via 10.23.2.44

delete it with 

$ ip route del 192.168.45.0/24

---------------
NetworkManager
---------------

NetworkManager is a daemon that the systems starts uppon boot 

it will follow this order 

If a wired connection is available try to connect usin it first 
otherwise try the wireless

if you recognize a wireless connection try that again 

if you know more than one select the most recently used 

use nmcli to control netowrkmanager from the command line 
 
its general config dir is usually /etc/NetworkManager 

----------------
add hosts/dns
----------------

override hostname lookups with /etc/hosts file 

you'll usually see your local host and server names 

ex
bobbie@Debbies:/etc$ cat hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.1.1	Debbies

- the local machine does not normally store and cache dns names 
instead it will use a daemon like systemd-resolved, dnsmasq, nscd 
or BIND 

you can tell if your running a name caching daemon if you see 
127.0.0.53 or 127.0.0.1 in /etc/resolv.conf or if you run 

$ nslookup -debug host

check the current dns settings with 

$ resolvectl status
	or systemd-resolved.. but i couldnt find it 

--------
dhcp
--------

dhclient 
	once started dhclient strore its process id in 
	/var/run/dhclient.pid and its lease info in 
	/var/lib/dhcp/dhclient/leases

to test dhclient run 

$ dhclient [interface]
*note the default gateway must be removed first*

you can also run a linux machine as a dhcp server

-----------------------
configuring as a router
-----------------------

because routers are just computers with multiple interfaces 
you can configure linux to as run as a router

you really just need the machine to be the default gateway and 
set up the routes. 

However the kernal may not have this enabled by default 
	turn it on with the following 

# sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

to make this change perm, add it to /etc/sysctl.conf
you may have to put it into /etc/sysctl.d so that updates wont 
bother it 

---------
NAT
---------

in order to set up a linux machine to perform as a NAT router 
you must activate all of the following inside the kernel config 

network packet filtering ("firewall support"), 
connection tracking
iptables support, 
full NAT, 
MASQUERADE target support

example how to enter the commands 

# sysctl -w net.tpv4.ip_forward=1
# iptables -P FORWARD DROP
# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
# iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
