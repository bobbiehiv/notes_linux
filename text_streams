===================================================
redirection and pipes
===================================================

use cat to redirect standard input 
	if you dont specify where cat will read from 
	it will read what you type

$ cat > mytextfile
	this is a test 
	you are tall

$ cat mytextfile	
	this is a test
	you are tall

the > tells cat to direct to mytextfile not std output

$ cat mytextfile > mynewtextfile
$ cat mynewtextfile
	this is a test
	i hope that cat is storing this to mytextfile

	this copies my textfile to mynewtextfile
	use diff to verifiy

$ diff mynewtextfile mytextfile
	(no output = no difference)

now append the redirection operator

$ echo 'this is a tallline' >> mynewtextfile
$ diff mynewtextfile mytextfile
	4d3
	< this is my new tall line

Now grep with pipes 

$ cat mytextfile | grep this
	prints lines with this
$ cat mytextfile | grep -i this
	prints lines with this not case sensitive

--------------------
passing text streams
--------------------

create a file called tall.txt containing a list of commands 

$ touch tall.txt 

$ cat tall.txt
	bzcat
	cat
	cut
	head
	less
	md5sum

grep the lines containing cat

$ cat tall.txt | grep cat

Or 

$ grep cat tall.txt
	send text to stdout

compress tall.txt with gzip

$ gzip tall.txt
$ ls 
	tall.txt.gz

use zcat to view the contents of the gzipped file

$ zcat tall.txt.gz
	bzcat
	cat
	cut
	head
	less
	md5sum
	
-------------------
view file in pager
-------------------

Since cat prints the file to stdout try to use the cat 
/var/log/syslog

$ sudo cat /var/log/syslog
	fast output!
	pipe it to less to make pages tho

$ sudo less /var/log/syslog
	
use head or tail to read the first ten lines or the last 

$ sudo head /var/log/syslog
	pipe it thru n1 to number the lines 

$ sudo head /var/log/syslog | n1

Or try the word count command wc, with -1 to print the number
	of lines 

$ sudo head /var/log/syslog | wc -1

use the -n option to view more or less lines 

$ sudo head -n 5 /var/log/syslog 

----
sed
----

checkout files in tall.txt.gz that dont have cat in the name

$ zcat tall.txt.gz | grep -v cat

unzip tall.txt with gzip

$ gunzip tall.txt.gz

use sed to list only the lines containing cat 

$ sed -n /cat/p < tall.txt

the less than sign directs the contents of tall.txt into the 
sed command, the word between //'s is the search word
	the -n says produce no output, except for 
	what p specifies 

to run it with out the -n 

$ sed /cat/d < tall.txt

sed will print everything from the file EXcept what is in "//d" 

sed is useful for replace or swaping strings 

use the s option to swap out cat for dog in tall.txt 

$ sed s/cat/dog/ < tall.txt

you dont have to use < , the following will make a back up as well 

$ sed -i.backup s/cat/dog/ tall.txt

**if you dont use .backup you will rewrite origanal prior to 
	modifications

---------------
data integrity
---------------

comparing checksums

$ sha256sum tall.txt
	prints checksum

Create a file that contains that value use the sha256sum command

$ sha256sum tall.txt > sha256.txt

to verify the tall.txt file use the same command, -c and the file 

$ sha256sum -c sha256.txt 
	tall.txt: ok

if anyhting changes it will fail, for instance 

$ echo "stupid" >> tall.txt
	run the check again 

$ sha256sum -c sha256.txt 
	tall.txt: FAILED

---------------
octal dump (od)
---------------

the octal dump is used for debugging appplications and files
by itself the od command will just list a files contents in 
	octal format

$ od tall.txt

0000000 075142 060543 005164 060543 005164 072543 005164 062550
0000020 062141 066012 071545 005163 062155 071465 066565 067012
0000040 005154 062157 070012 071541 062564 071412 062145 071412

The first column of output is the byte offset for each line 
the byte offset is 8 bits followed by 8 collumns, which contain the 
octal value of that column

Need to view in hexidecimenl? use -x 

$ od -x tall.txt

0000000 7a62 6163 0a74 6163 0a74 7563 0a74 6568

You can also use the command to debug scripts 

$ od -c tall.txt

0000000 b z c a t \n c a t \n c u t \n h e

View without offset info

$ od -An -c tall.txt

b z c a t \n c a t \n c u t \n h e

notes 

cat, bzcat, xzcat, zcat - view contents of siped type

use sort to list alphabetically, reverse, or random

$ sort

use uniq to list a count matching strings

$ uniq

use  sha512sum sha256sum or md5sum

for calculating the hashvalues
