logs
====================================================

most system programs write their diagnostic output as messages to the syslog service

Journald (with systemd) waits for these messages and sends them to 
the appropriate channels 

run journalctl to see the outputs

$ journalctl

journald srote its files in binary in /var/log/journal

filtering journalctl's output 

you can search with a specific pid ex. 

$ journalctl _PID=8792

by time with -s 

$ journalctl -s -4h

where -4h is 4 hours, you can also use 
specific times/days/etc

you can also filter by systemd units 

$ journalctl -u cron.service

if you dont know the name of a perticular unit, try this 

$ journalctl -F _SYSTEMD_UNIT

the -F option shows all values in the journal for a perticular feild 

list all available fields with -N

$ journalctl -N

filter by text 

$ journalctl -g 'kernal.*memory'

boot logs 

$ journalctl -b 

to start at the previous boot use an offset of -1 

$ journalctl -b -1

View Boots by IDs 

$ journalctl --list-boots

serach for specific severity levels with 

$ journalctl -p 3 

for general log monitoring use 

$ journalctl -f 

-------------------
log file rotation 
--------------------

most distros use the logrotate utility 

logrotate sections the log information into chunks 
then deletes data as it gets older and older renaming it as well 

however the journals stored in /var/log/journal dont need rotation because 
journald itself manages removing messages
