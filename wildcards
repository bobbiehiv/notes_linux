===========
wildcards
===========

file globbing represent multiple filenames by using special 
characters called wildcards

use wildcards with cp, ls, and rm 

Deletes all files in working dir

$ rm * 

list all files with names begining with l and followed by a
	single character and ending with st

$ ls l?st

remove all directories whose name starts with a letter 

$ rmdir [a-z]*

There are three types of wildcards 

* - represents zero one or more occurances of any character 
? - represents a single occurance 
[]- represents any occurance of the characters enclosed inside

examples 

$ find /home -name *.png
$ ls lpic-*.txt
$ cp -r animal/* forest
$ rm *ate*

$ ls l?st.txt 

$ ls l[aef]st.txt
	would match last.txt and lest.txt
$ ls l[a-z]st.txt
	is a range

Try combining them 

$ ls [plf]?st*
	last.txt lest.txt list.txt past.txt
