dpkg
=========================================================

The debian package tool

install .deb packages as so

# dpkg -i PACKAGENAME.deb

If a previous version exist, it will be upgraded to the 
new version

------------
Dependencies
------------

dpkg will check if the nessacary dependancies are installed
on the system, and will fail if they are not

Sometimes thy will list what packages are missing, 
but it cant solve depeancies by itself
	you have to find the .deb packages and install them

---------------
remove packages
---------------

to remove packages use

$ dpkg -r PACKAGENAME.deb

-r also runs a dependancy check
	packages cant be removed unless every other 
	pacakge that depends on it is also removed

if you pass multiple package names they will all be 
removed at once

	when a packae is removed the corresponding files 
	are left, to remove everything assiosciated 
	use -P instead of -r

--------------------------
listing installed packages
--------------------------

you can force install with --force

to get info about the .deb package

# dpkg -I FILename.deb

get a list of every package installed on your system.

# dpkg --get-selections 

or a list of every file installed by a specific pacakage
	use

# dpkg -L PACKaGE

find out which pacakge own a file

# dpkg-query -S /path/to/the/file

reconfiguring installed packages to defaults
	backs up the old config
	unpack the new ones 
	and run the post install script provided 
	by the package

# dpkg-reconfigure PACKAGE
