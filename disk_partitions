Disk Partitioning 

============================================================================

Linux Partitioning tools 

parted - text based tool that supports but MBR and GPT

gparted - a graphical verison of parted

fdisk - a traditional partitioning tool, recently support for MBR and GPT
	
	* Note parted works in realtime, where as fdisk makes the 
	change once you exit and confirm

View your systems partition table with 

$ parted -l  $ fdisk - l 

When runing 

$ sudo journalctl -k | grep sda 

you can see the following 

	Aug 01 16:06:20 Debbies kernel:  sda: sda1 sda2 < sda5 >

		sda2 <sda5> means that sda2 is an extended partition containing 
		one logical partition, <sda5>
	
concerns when modifying partitions 

	make sure to back up

	and ensure no partitions on your target disk are in use
		(linux will auto mount detected filesystems)

$ udevadm monitor --kernel 
	watch the devices being partitioned

======================================
Creating a partition table 
======================================

start at the command prompt with the devices name 

# fdisk /dev/sda
	you'll receive the following prompt
	Command (m for help): 
			    : p (to print the the current table)
			    : d (to delete the current table)
			    : n (for new partion)
			    Partition type: p (primary) or e (extended)
			    Partition number: 1 - 4 
			    first sector: 2048 - 836127 (defaults fine)
			    last sector: +200M (or other size)

			    Next partition is the same with all defaults to take 
			    the rest of the space
			    when finished use 
			    : p (print)
			    : w (write)
