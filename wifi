wifi
===================================================

to view and change the kernal device and netowrk configs with 
iw

to use iw you need to know the device name ex 'wlan0'

use iw to dump a list of available networks 

$ iw dev (wirless card) scan

you may have to set the dev to up first 

$ ip link set  wlan0 up

use iw to connect a netowrk dev to a unsecured wireless netowrk 

$ iw wlan0 connect (SSID)

*note

for most wireless security setups linux relies on the wpa_supplicant daemon to 
manage both auth and encryption for a wireless network interface

it can handle wpa2 and 3, dont use wpa

when the daemon first starts it reads the daemon file located in 
/etc/wpa_supllicant.conf and attempts to identify it self to an access point
