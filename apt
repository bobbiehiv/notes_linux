APT
=========================================================

the advanced package tool 
	provides more features than dpkg

apt is not a replacement for dpkg, its more of a front end
	streamlining and filling in gaps.

apt works with software repos, which contain the packages 
available to install 

some utilities 

apt-get
	used to download upgrade or remove
apt-cache
	used to preform operations like searches in the 	
	package index
apt-file
	used for searching for files inside packages

apt 
	is also used combining all most common utils of 
	apt-get and apt-cache

always update before installing so you get the latest of 
what youre getting 

# apt-get update (or just apt)

Then install 

# apt-get install PACKAGE

or remove 

# apt-get remove PACKAGE

Apt will automatically remove or resolve package 
dependancies, but it will also show you and ask to 
continue

to remove the corresponding config files for a package use
purge instead of remove. or use remove with --purge

# apt-get pugre PACKAGE 
# apt-get remove --purge PACKAGE

--------------------------
fixing broken dependencies
--------------------------

Broken dependancies are when one or more of the installed packages 
depend on other pacages that havent been installed yet, or have been 
removed

to fix this issue 

$ apt-get install -f 
	tries to fix the broken packages by installing missing 
	dependancies

----------
upgrade
----------

use apt to upgrade any installed packages to the latest versions 
available from the repos

$ apt-get upgrade
$ apt-get upgrade PACKAGE

------------
local cache
------------

When you install or update a package the .deb file is downloaded 
to a local cache directory before the package is installed.
by default it is /var/cache/apt/archives
partially downloaded ones are in /var/cache/apt/archives/partial

to reclaim space and empty cache use 

$ apt-get clean
	will remove contents of above directories

apt-cache can be used to perform operations on the package index
such as searching for a specific package or listing which packages 
contain a file

to conduct a search use

$ apt-cache search PATTERN
	lists every instance of that pattern in its name description
	or files 

Use the show command to dig deeper into entrys 

$ apt-cache show PACKAGE

		* you can use regular expresions to get more granular 
		  information
		you can also use $ apt search instead

-----------------
the sources list
-----------------

apt uses a list of sources to know where to get packages from
the list is stored in the file sources.list located in the 
/etc.apt directory
	this file can be edited direcly

a line will look like the following 

deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ disco main restricted universe multiverse

the syntax is apchive type, url, distrobution and one or more components

	archive type 
		a repo may contain packages with ready to run softwar
		bin's type deb. or with the source code to this software
		the example above provides binary packages
	URL
		the url for the repo
	Distribution
		the name or code name for the distrobution
	components 
		each compnents represents a set of packages
		components may be different on different distros
	   Ubuntu  style ones are 

	main  
		contains officially supported, open-source packages
	restricted 
		contains officially supported, closed-source software, 
		like device drivers for graphic cards
	universe
		contains community maintained open-source software
	Multiverse
		contains unsupported, closed-source or 
		patent-encumbered software

	Debian ones are 
	
	main
		consists of packages compliant with the Debian Free 
		Software Guidelines (DFSG), which donot rely on software
		outside this area to operate. Packages included here are
		considered to be part of the Debian distribution 
	contrib
		contains DFSG-compliant packages, but which depend on 
		other packages that are not in main
	non-free
		contains packages that are not compliant with the DFSG
	security
		Security updates
	backports
		contains more recent versions of packages that are in main

to add a new repo to get packages from to can add a line to the end 
of sources.list
	save the file and reload the index with apt-get update
	after that you can use apt install to get packages from the 
	repo

you can also add file with addtional repos to be used by apt 
	/etc/apt/sources.list.d
	use the .list extention

----------------------------------
listing contents and finding files
----------------------------------

apt-file cab be used to list or find the contents in a package, or 
find a package that contains a certian file

install it first 

$ apt-get install apt-file

then update the package cache used for apt-file

# apt-file update

list the contents with list 

# apt-file list PACKAGE

search which packages use which files

# apt-file search FIlename

** apt-file search will search uninstalled packages, unlike 
	dpkg-query
