shell scripts
=========================================================================

shell scripts generally start with 

#!/bin/sh

#! is called the shebang 

you can list any commands you want the shell to execute following #!/bin/sh

ex 
#!/bin/sh
# print something then run ls 

echo about to run the ls command 
ls

you will also need to set the exe bit and the read bit 

$ chmod +rx script 
	this allows anyone to run the script, change perm if you want 



when running a script the shell first looks for varibles, globs and other 
substitutions and performs the substitutions if they appear. 

then the shell passes the subs to the command 

----------
quotes
----------

use single quotes to make the shell leave a string alone 

$ grep 'r.*t' /etc/passwd

all characters between the two single quuotes make up a single parameter

always use single quotes for strings like this first 

double quoutes however work similarly but the shell will expand any varibles 
that appear within the double quotes 

try 

$ echo "there is no * in my path: $PATH"
	the shell subs $PATH but not *

----------------------
literal single quotes
----------------------

easiest way is to just use a backslash 

$ echo this isn\'t stupid

----------------------
individual arguements
----------------------

$1 $2 and all varibles named as positive nonzero integers contain the valies 
of the script parameters, or arguements 

example script 

#!/bin/sh
echo first argument: $1
echo third argument: $3 

will print as

$ ./pshow one two three
echo first argument: one
echo third argument: three

use the built in shell command shift to shift from 
2 to 1, 3 to 2, etc 

#!/bin/sh
echo first argument: $1
shift
echo first argument: $1
shift
echo first argument: $1

run it to see it shift 

$ ./shiftex one two three

#!/bin/sh
echo first argument: one
echo first argument: two
echo first argument: three

--------------------------------

the $# varible holds the number of arguments passed to a script and is important 
when running shif in a loop to pick thru arguments 

the $@ varible represents all of a scripts arguments and is useful for passing them 
to a command inside of a script

the $0 varible holds the name of the scripts and is useful for generating diagnostic 
messages 

the $$ varible holds the process ID of the shell 

the $? varible holds the exit code of the last command used 

----------------------------------

Exit codes 

when a program finishes it will leave an exit code 
when the exit code is 0 it usually means the program ran without a problem 

if its any other number it could mean there was an error
run a function or program and check 

$ echo $?

that code will be overwritten by the next process, so if you need that code 
save it quick * running it twice will always show 0 because the first echo $? ran 
fine 

-------------------------------------

Conditionals 

the shell uses if/then/else and case statements 

example script 
#!/bin/sh
if [ $1 = hi ]; then
    echo 'the first argument was "hi"'
else 
    echo -n 'the first argument was not "hi" --'
    echo it was '"'$1'"'
fi

the word if else and fi are all keywords while everything else is a command 

for the above 

the shel funs the command after the if keword and collects the code of that command 

if the exit code is 0, the shell executes the commands that follow 

if it was not 0 it runs the else clause 

and the conditional ends at fi 

* the ; after [] is useful for seperating the commands, however you could 
just use a seperate line as well

---------------------------------------------

Logical constructs 

&& 

with && the shell will run the first command and if the exit code is 0 
run the next command

||

the || is similar, if the command before the || returns a non zero exit code than it 
will run the next commnad 

$ command1 && command2 
$ command1 || command2

or 

#!/bin/sh
if [ "$1" = hi ] || [ "$1" = bye ]; then
    echo 'the first argument was "'$1'"'
fi

invert a test by placing a ! before a test 

#!/bin/sh
if [ ! "$1" = hi ] || [ "$1" = bye ]; then
    echo 'the first argument was "'$1'"'

fi

--------------------------------------------------

[ ] is also know as test, if the test exit code is 0 then its true 
non zero then fails 

--------------------------------------------------

there are dozens of test operations but they all fall into 
three main catagories 

file, string, and arthmitic tests 

most file tests like -f are called unary operations because they 
require only one argument... the file to test 

 two important file tests 

	-e returns true if a file exists 
	-s returns true if a file is not empty 

  file type operators 
  -f 		regular file 
  -d		directory 
  -h 		symbolic link
  -b 		block device
  -c 		character device 
  -p		named pipe
  -s		socket

  file permissions operators 
  -r		readable 
  -w		writable 
  -x		executable
  -u		setuid
  -g		setguid
  -k		sticky

three binary operators (tests that need two files as arguments )

consider this with -nt (newer than)

[ file1 -nt file2 ] 

this will exit true if file 1 has a newer modification than file2 

use -ot (older than) to do the opposite 

and if you need to compare hard links, -ef compares and retuens true if 
the share inode numbers and devices 

-------------------------------------------------------

=   - equals 
!=  - not equals 
-z  - true if an argument is empty 
-n  - true if an argument is not empty

--------------------------------------------------------

case 

case is a conditional construct that is useful for matching strings 
it does not evalute exit codes, however it does do pattern matching 

example 
!#/bin/sh
case $1 in 
    bye)
    	echo fine, bye.
	;;
    hi|hello)
    	echo Nice to see you 
	;;
    what*)
    	echo Whatever
	;;
    *)
    	echo 'huh?'
	;;
esac

--- the script matches $1 against each case value demarceted with the ')'
--- if a case value matches $1 the shell executes the command below it untill it hits ;;
	then it skips to the esac
--- the conditional ends with esac

for each case value you can match a single string or multiple strings seperate with | 

	end each case with ;;

-------------------------------------------------------------

Loops 

for loops 

example 
!#/bin/sh
for str in one two three four; do 
    echo $str
done

if the above, it will set teh $str varible to the first of the values (one)
runs the command between do and done 
goes back and does the next value untill its out of values 

will print out 
one 
two 
three
four

while loops 

while loops use exit codes, like the if conditional

you can break out of while loops with the break statment or until
probably wont use while loops often in shell scripts tho 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Temp file management 

use the mktemp command to create temp filenames

example 

#!/bin/sh
TMPFILE1=(mktemp /tmp/im1.XXXXXX)
TMPFILE2=(mktemp /tmp/im2.XXXXXX)

cat /proc/interrupts > $TEMPFILE1
sleep 2 
cat /proc/interrupts > TEMPFILE2
diff $TEMPFILE1 $TEMPFILE2
rm -f $TEMPFILE1 $TEMPFILE2

the argument to mktemp is a template
mktemp converts XXXXXX to a unique set of characters and creates 
an empty file with that name 

if temp file scripts are aborted they leave behind scraps in /tmp

use the trap command to avoid this problem 

#!/bin/sh
TMPFILE1=(mktemp /tmp/im1.XXXXXX)
TMPFILE2=(mktemp /tmp/im2.XXXXXX)
trap "rm -f $TEMPFILE1 $TEMPFILE2; exit 1" INT

---------------------------------------------------------------

Utilities 

basename 
useful for striping the extention of a filename or to get rid of the 
directories in a full path name 

$ basename example.html
$ basename ~/home/me/example

	both will return 'example'

example 

#!/bin/bash
for file in *.gif; do 
	# exit if there are no files 
    if [ ! -f $file }; then
    	exit
    fi
    b=$(basename $file .gif)
    echo Converting $b.gif to $b.png...
    giftopnm $b.gif | pnmtopng > $b.png
done
