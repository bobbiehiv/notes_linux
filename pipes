pipes and filters
=============================================

the capability to read data from a std input and send to std 
output is utilized with pipes 

the std output of one command can be piped into the std input 
of another 

for instance 

$ ls -l /usr/bin | less
	pipes the output of the ls command into less to page thru

you may also sort them 

$ ls -l /bin /usr/bin | sort | less

or use the uniq command which is often used with sort, uniq receives input 
and removes the duplicates 

$ ls -l /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq | less

or you could see only the duplicates with 

$ ls -l /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq -d | less

--
wc
--

use wc to print the word, line, and byte counts

$ wc ls-output.txt

use the -l option to print only line counts and add it to the above command

$ ls -l /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq | less | wc -l
