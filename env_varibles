Enviroment Varibles.

===============================

The shell can store temorary varibles 
called shell varibles containing the value of text strings. 

$ STUFF=gay
$ echo $STUFF
  gay

you can assign an enviroment varible with the export command

$ export STUFF

child processes inheiret from their parent, so many programs 
read them for configs

=============
PATH
=============

enviroment varible that contains the 'command path'

The command path is a list of system dir's that the shell searches

ex. if you run ls the shell searches the dir's in PATH for ls
	if more than one it picks the first one 

Run

$ echo $PATH

- paths are seperated by colons

$ PATH=dir:$PATH 
---adds dir to the beginging of the path 
$PATH=$PATH:dir
---adds dir to the end of the path

not perminant unless you chang the config files
