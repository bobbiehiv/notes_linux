TCP services examples 

telnet to this server below

$ telnet example.org 80

and enter the following lines 

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org

to terminate Crtl-D

Likewise try out the curl utility with an option to record 
details about its http connection 

$ curl --trace-ascii trace_file http://www.example.org/

youll get alot of output you can disregard, but it will
also create a trace_file to check out. 

this trace file will tell you everything that curl did with 
the destination address
