====================================

Standard Streams

====================================

stdin 		Standard input 

stdout	 =1	Standard ouput

stderr   =2	Standard error  

$ sudo apt update
$ echo $?
0

prints in binary either 0 or 1.. anyhting
not 0 is a error

use the stdin out and error to split results 

$ find /etc -type f 1> ~/results.txt 2> ~/errors.txt

- in the above the 1 is unneeded because it is assumed
	but it points all of the outputs to results.txt

- also the 2 points all the errors that would output
	to the error.txt

---note this will overwrite the results file if it exists

	to avoid use >> not > 
		which will append it to the end

----also -type f denotes its a regular file

	so you are searching for all the files in /etc

- you may also send the stdout and stderr to the same place 

$ find /etc -type f 2>&1
