sshd
============================================

an sshd server allowed to remotely connect toy your systems 
requires a config file and host keys 

most distros keep configs in /etc/ssh

** dont confuse sshd_config with ssh_config

you shouldnt normally need to change much in this file 
it consists of key value pairs 

important parameters

HostKey file - uses file as host key

PermitRootLogin value - Permits the superuser to log in with ssh
	if set to yes 

LogLevel level - Logs messages to syslog level (defaults to INFO)

SyslogFacility name - Logs messages to syslog facality name (defaults to AUTH)

X11Forwarding value - enables X windows system client tunneling if 
	set to yes 

XAuthLocation path - specifies the location of xauth utility 

to have ssh start at boot use 

$ systemctl enable sshd

or to start up in general

$ systemctl start sshd

-------------------
creating host keys
-------------------

Openssh has host key sets, each has a public key (.pub) and a private (no extention)

to create keys use 

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -N '' -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
and/or 
$ ssh-keygen -t dsa -N '' -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key

-------------
ssh clien
-------------

to log into a remote host 

$ ssh username@remote_host

you can also pipe dirs to remote hosts

$ tar zcvf - dir | ssh remote_hot tar zxvf -

---------------
file transfer
---------------

openssh includes file transfer programs scp and sftp which are replacements for 
rcp and ftp

it works mostly like cp 

Copy a file from a remote host to the current directory 

$ scp user@host:file . 

copy from a local machine to a remote host 

$ scp file user@host:dir

copy a file from one remote host to another 

$ scp user1@host1:file user2@host2:dir 

sftp works just like ftp, with get and put commands
