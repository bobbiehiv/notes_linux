/var 
========================================================

varible data or files and directories the system must be 
able to write to during operation. 

includes 

system logs in /var/log
temp files in / var/tmp
cached app data in /var/cache

/var/www/html is the default direcory for the data files 
for the apache web server
/var/lib/mysql is the default location for database files 
for mysql server 

a good reason for putting /var in a seperate partition is 
stablility 

a program could write data to a /var file untill there is 
no room on the drive at all

keep /home /var /boot/efi or /boot under thier own 
partitions

Swap partition cant be mounted like others 
must be set up with a utility called mkswap

usually 2x the ampount of ram

2-8gb of ram equal to the amount of ram
8-64gb of ram at least 4gb 
> 64gb of ram at least 4gb
